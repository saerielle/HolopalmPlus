# Holopalm Plus
Source code for the Holopalm Plus mod for the game I Was a Teenage Exocolonist

UI enhancement mod: character story notifications, job previews, enhanced choice tooltips, character info and gift preference tracking.

## Notification Overlay
Displays notifications for new character stories and birthdays, with up to 5 notifications shown at a time. No more running around the colony looking for speech bubbles - see at a glance who has new stories available, including friends, parents, and even Sym on expeditions. Also alerts you to special interactions like dates, skill-based conversations, Rex's hugs and bar building, character birthdays, as well as some colony events. Notification overlay is only shown starting from the 2nd in game month and if there are actual notifications to show at any given time.

## Job Story Preview
Visual indicators on job selection screen show what might happen:
- ‚òÜ - First time doing this job
- ‚òÖ - Job will trigger an event-type story
- ‚òÖ - Job will trigger an "ultimate" event story (usually unlocks new cards and boosts job rewards)
- ‚òÜ - Job will unlock another job
Updated tooltip now shows how many times you've done a specific job or expedition this playthrough.

## Expedition Job Preview
As part of Job Story Preview: Special indicators on expedition selection screen (predictions for maps not visited this year, facts for visited ones):
- ‚òÜ - Start story available (mini-story at expedition beginning)
- ‚òÜ - New expedition map unlock story available
- ‚òÖ - Quest story available (special stories with golden exclamation marks)
- ‚òÖ - Boss event has respawned on already-visited map
- [n] - Number of remaining stories + collectibles on visited map
- ‚úì - All stories done and collectibles collected this year

## Frequent Job Stories
Special event-type job stories can occur more often than the base game's alternating system, which often results in basic snippet stories even if requirements for eventful stories are met.

## Glow Job Stories
Enables special event-type job stories to occur during Glow season, lifting the usual lore-based restrictions.

## Highlight Seen Options
Visual highlighting for dialogue choices you've selected in your previous playthroughs, without auto-skipping them.

## Extended Choice Preview
Shows detailed information about previously seen choices (requires "Highlight seen options" to be enabled):
- ‚ù§ with "+/-" - Friendship changes only
- Skill icon - Skill changes only
- ? - Multiple different effects or special memory flag changes (like helping Tangent, Tammy's confidence, etc.)
- ‚Üë - Choice provides more information/lore without advancing story
Detailed tooltips - shows specific friendship gains/losses, skill changes, and special memory flag effects. When a choice leads to only one follow-up option, the tooltip recursively combines all effects from the entire chain, giving you the complete outcome preview since there are no branching decisions ahead.

## Extended Character Bio
Shows current ending and dating status in your bio, plus birthdays and full names for all non-friend characters, as well as hidden dating flags.

Includes:
- Your current calculated job ending
- Who you're currently dating
- Full names and birthdays for non-befriendable colonists
- Hidden dating status tracking (Marz + Rex, Dys + Sym flags that the base game doesn't display)

## Gift Preferences (Show Gift Icons)
Shows icons for liked, disliked, neutral and unknown collectibles when gifting.

Gift indicators added by this mod:
- ‚ù§ Heart for items they love
- üëéThumbs down for dislikes
-  ? Question mark for unknown preferences
- No icon for neutral items
Note: Neutral gift tracking only begins after installing this mod - it can't retroactively know about neutral gifts from before installation because base game only tracks if you have discovered likes and dislikes of a character.
